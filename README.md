# DSA-Sorting-Exercise

This project contains JavaScript implementations of foundational sorting algorithms, along with their associated unit tests.

## Implemented Algorithms

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own `.js` file and is accompanied by a corresponding `.test.js` file for unit testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

### Included

| Algorithm       | Implementation File | Test File           |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Bubble Sort     | `bubble.js`         | `bubble.test.js`    |
| Insertion Sort  | `insertion.js`      | `insertion.test.js` |
| Merge Sort      | `merge.js`          | `merge.test.js`     |
